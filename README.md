# MDP-Stock-Prediction
Uses MDP to predict the best action to take (BUY, HOLD, or SELL) for a stock.
In order to run the program, type "python YahooDataParser.py"

## Predicting Optimal Actions For Your Stock
To configure the application with your preferred stock selections, simply update the "companies" list by replacing its current elements with the ticker symbols corresponding to the companies for which you'd like the application to provide action predictions. The "companies" list can be found in the "YahooDataParser.py" class on line 72.

The purpose of this application is to act as a potential algorithmic implementation for prediction optimal actions for stocks. As such, UI was not the focus of this project (though, future updates may incorporate UI for simplicity and easy of use).
